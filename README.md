# Smart Board

This is a code repository for the Smart Board project. It is an IoT-based project, used to operate home appliances remotely as well as manually. The Smart Board project is a real-time controller for home appliances using voice recognition technology integrated with Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home devices. The project aims to enhance productivity, create a healthier work environment, and improve energy usage by allowing users to control appliances through voice commands. Overall, the Smart Board project demonstrates the practical application of IoT and voice recognition technology in home automation, offering convenience and accessibility for users, including those with disabilities.

## Working:

By registering control devices to the Sinric Pro server and utilizing the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, users can give voice commands to turn devices on or off, with the system processing these commands and controlling the connected devices accordingly. The project also allows for manual control of devices and automatic scheduling for power on/off through the Sinric Pro API.

## Features of this project:

- Based on IoT.
- Integrated with Node MCU.
- Simply plug in any home appliances to make it remotely accessible (ON/OFF).
- Uses Sinric Pro API.
- Can be connected using WiFi.
- Can be operated via Alexa/Google devices or apps.

## Components used:

- Node MCU (ESP8266).
- 4-channel Relay Module.
- Switches, electric board, and wires.
- Alexa/Google Home devices or app.
- 240V AC power supply.
- WiFi network.

## Conclusion:

It is evident from this project work that an individual control home automation system can be cheaply made from low-cost locally available components and can be used to control diverse home appliances ranging from the security lamps, and the television to the air conditioning system and even the entire house lighting system. Better still, the components required are so small and few that they can be packaged into small, inconspicuous containers.
